    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Maksym Krasnianskyi, and I am 19 years old.
        Currently, I am enrolled in my second year of the Odessa Polytechnic,
        where I am dedicated to advancing my expertise in the realm of technical sciences,
        particularly focusing on "Computer sciences."
        My linguistic capabilities encompass English, Ukrainian and Russian.
        As an aspiring front-end developer, I have gained proficiency in a range of technologies,
        including HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, SASS, and GIT.
        My passion lies in crafting innovative and user-friendly websites that seamlessly blend creativity with functionality.
        Beyond my academic pursuits and coding endeavors,
        I am recognized for my strong interpersonal skills and diligent work ethic.
        I firmly believe in the value of collaboration and mutual support within a team setting.
        Eager to contribute to fresh initiatives,
        I am committed to honing my skills in the dynamic field of front-end development through continuous learning and hands-on experience.
        I am enthusiastic about taking on new challenges and eager to be a part of engaging projects that push the boundaries of web development.
        I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to and grow with your projects.
